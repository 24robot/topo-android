What is Topo?
------------
Topo aims to be a beautifully-designed app that helps you manage your to-dos.

Why not other to-do apps?
-------------------------
Topo differentiates itself from other to-do apps by helping users pick their top 3 tasks as Primary tasks and focus on them alone, at any point of time. The user doesn't have to worry about the remaining tasks in his/her to-do list.

How can I contribute?
--------------------
You can suggest new ideas, help with the design, report bugs and send pull requests containing bug-fixes. We're not taking in pull requests containing new features as we're still figuring out what features the app should contain and what it shouldn't.

Where can I find the app?
-------------------------
This is the link to the app on the Android Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robots2.topo

Do I use Eclipse or Android Studio?
----------------------------------
The app is currently being built using Eclipse. Therefore, you can directly use it in Eclipse or import it into Android Studio.
